My Best AutoHotKey Produtiviy Scripts. Enjoy!
Some scripts were written by me and my idea.
Many are modified by me over time and original created by others.

AutoHotkey is required to run and/or compile the scripts. The compiled scripts can be executed without autohotkey installed on user's machine.
